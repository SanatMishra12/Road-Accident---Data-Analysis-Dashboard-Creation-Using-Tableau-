Project Objective : Accident and Road Safety Analysis :

1. To analyze the overall trend of road accidents over time.
2. To identify high-risk regions and accident hotspots using geospatial analysis.
3. To study the severity levels of accidents (fatal, serious, slight).
4. To evaluate casualty patterns based on age group, gender, and road user type.
5. To understand the role of vehicle type involvement in accidents.
6. To provide interactive and visual insights for policymakers, researchers, and safety authorities.

Dataset Used : 
<a href="https://github.com/SanatMishra12/Road-Accident---Data-Analysis-Dashboard-Creation-Using-Tableau-/blob/main/accident_data.csv.gz">Dataset</a>

Question(KPIs) : 

1. What is the total number of accidents over time?
2. Which regions/locations report the highest number of accidents?
3. What is the distribution of accidents by severity (fatal, serious, minor)?
4. What are the common causes of accidents (speeding, drunk driving, weather, road conditions, etc.)?
5. What is the relationship between vehicle type and accident frequency?
6. How many accidents involved casualties vs. non-casualties?
